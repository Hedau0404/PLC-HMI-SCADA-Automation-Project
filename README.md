PLC–HMI–SCADA Automation Project

Platform: Arduino Opta PLC, Ignition SCADA
Protocol: Modbus TCP/IP
Database: SQLite (Tag Historian)

Overview
Developed a complete PLC–HMI–SCADA system demonstrating sequential control, operator interaction, data logging, and scripting-based tag management.

Key Features

Sequential control logic using timers and counters
Real-time HMI with status indicators, Start/Stop controls, and setpoints
PLC–SCADA communication via Modbus TCP
Tag History enabled with trend visualization
Python scripting to break PLC arrays into individual SCADA tags
Expression tags for logical validation and interlocks

Technical Highlights

PLC programming on Arduino Opta
Ignition HMI design and animation
Python scripting for dynamic tag creation
SQL historian for process data logging
Relative tag paths and expression logic
